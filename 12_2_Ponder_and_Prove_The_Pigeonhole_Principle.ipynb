By dividing this by 365 (ignoring leap years), we get 21,519,480.02. We take the ceiling of this, meaning there are at least 21,519,481 people who share the same birthday. Similarly, 250 people were born the same second ($365 \\text{ days } \\cdot 24 \\text{ hours } \\cdot 60 \\text{ minutes } \\cdot 60 \\text{ seconds } = 31,536,000$; $7,854,610,208 / 31,536,000 \\approx 249.07$).\n",
